# ADR-001: Redux State Structure

## Context
We have a React + Redux + Redux-Saga Cordova Application. Our product owner wants to test if the same application can run inside an Electron container. Right now our state contains both domain data and data relative to our particular UI. This is a roadblock for a real portable application. The "ui" part can use data, sagas and so on from the "core" part, but the contrary it's not permitted.

## Decision
We will divide the redux state in two main "branches". The first one "core" will contain all the data that is relative to the domain of our application. The other branch is "ui", in this part of the state we keep the data relative to this specific UI (mobile application). For example the values in the forms or the open / close of menu or navigation data. In the future the "core" part could become a separate package that the Electron application could use.

## Status 
accepted

## Consequences
Now it's easier to understand where to put variables in the Redux state. This is really helpful when try to solve a bug, because we usually know upfront where to look. Another consequence is that sometime we need some wrappers around sagas becase we can't just import ui part in the core.
